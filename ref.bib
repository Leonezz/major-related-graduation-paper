	abstract = {The intelligent treatment of urban garbage is an important component of creating a smart city and also solves several problems associated with urban garbage. Many traditional garbage cans are widely distributed, leading to great consumption of human and material, untimely government. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligent system based on edge computing and the narrow-band Internet of things (NB-IoT) for monitoring smart trash cans (STCs). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STC system improves the load capacity of garbage cans, requires few human and material resources, and allows for intelligent management of garbage in smart cities.},
